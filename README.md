# üìÑ PDF Image Extractor

A simple Streamlit-based web app that extracts image blocks from PDF files using computer vision techniques and allows users to download them individually or as a ZIP archive.

## üîç Step-by-Step Explanation of the Approach

1. **Upload PDF File**  
   The user uploads a PDF file through the app UI.

2. **PDF to Image Conversion**  
   Each page of the PDF is converted to a high-resolution image using `PyMuPDF` at 300 DPI.

3. **Image Block Detection**  
   - Convert the image to grayscale
   - Apply binary thresholding
   - Use `cv2.findContours()` to detect visual regions
   - Filter out small/noisy contours using size thresholds

4. **Image Extraction**  
   - Each valid image block is cropped from the page
   - Saved into an output folder

5. **Download Option**  
   - A ZIP archive of all extracted images is created
   - Users can download the full archive or individual images

6. **Image Display**  
   - Images are shown as thumbnails with optional individual download buttons

## üß© Challenges & Resolutions

| **Challenge**                                                              | **Resolution**                                                                                                                                                    |

| Large images crowding the UI                                              | Used `PIL.Image.thumbnail()` to resize images for display                                                                                                        |
| Unwanted text/noise in output                                             | Applied size filters and contour-based image block extraction                                                                                                   |
| UI elements rendering out of order                                        | Ensured the ZIP download button is displayed before showing the images                                                                                          |
| Managing temporary files                                                  | Used Python‚Äôs `tempfile` module to handle temporary directories safely and cleanly                                                                              |
| Inability to detect embedded images if not truly image-type content       | Since many "images" in PDFs are actually vector graphics or drawn content, traditional image extraction fails. We addressed this by using high-resolution rendering (300 DPI) and contour detection to extract visual regions resembling images, even if not embedded as raster image objects. |
